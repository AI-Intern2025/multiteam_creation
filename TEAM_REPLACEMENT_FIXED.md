# TEAM REPLACEMENT LOGIC FIXED 🔧

## 🎯 Issue Resolved
Fixed the player replacement logic in the TeamManager component to properly show only unselected players in the replacement dropdown.

## 🔍 Problem
Previously, when trying to replace a player in generated teams:
- **First dropdown (Replace Player)**: Showed ALL players from the pool
- **Second dropdown (With Player)**: Showed ALL players except the selected one

This caused confusion because users could see already selected players in the replacement options.

## ✅ Solution Implemented

### 1. **Bulk Player Replacement (Fixed)**
- **Replace Player dropdown**: Now only shows players who are actually IN the selected teams
- **With Player dropdown**: Now only shows players who are NOT in any of the selected teams

### 2. **Individual Player Replacement (New Feature)**
- Added individual "Replace" dropdown for each player in team cards
- Shows only unselected players (players NOT in the current team)
- Instant replacement with automatic credit calculation and validation

## 🚀 Code Changes

### Modified: `src/components/TeamManager.tsx`

#### Bulk Replacement Logic:
```tsx
// Replace Player - Only show players IN selected teams
{Array.from(new Set(
  teams
    .filter(team => selectedTeams.includes(team.id))
    .flatMap(team => team.players)
    .map(player => player.id)
))...}

// With Player - Only show players NOT in selected teams
{players
  .filter(p => {
    if (p.id === selectedPlayer) return false
    
    const isInSelectedTeams = teams
      .filter(team => selectedTeams.includes(team.id))
      .some(team => team.players.some(tp => tp.id === p.id))
    
    return !isInSelectedTeams
  })...}
```

#### Individual Replacement Logic:
```tsx
// Added replacement dropdown for each player
<select onChange={(e) => {
  if (e.target.value) {
    handleIndividualPlayerReplace(team.id, player.id, e.target.value)
  }
}}>
  <option value="">Replace</option>
  {players
    .filter(p => !team.players.some(tp => tp.id === p.id))
    .map(availablePlayer => (...))}
</select>
```

#### New Function:
```tsx
const handleIndividualPlayerReplace = (teamId, currentPlayerId, replacementPlayerId) => {
  // Replaces player in specific team
  // Recalculates credits and validation
  // Updates team state
}
```

## 🎮 User Experience Improvements

1. **Clear Player Lists**: Users now see exactly which players they can replace and which are available
2. **Individual Control**: Can replace any player in any team instantly
3. **Bulk Operations**: Improved bulk replacement for multiple teams at once
4. **Auto-Validation**: Credits and team validity are automatically recalculated
5. **Better UX**: Dropdown resets after selection, clear labels and tooltips

## 🔄 Workflow Now

### Individual Player Replacement:
1. Go to generated teams page
2. Find the player you want to replace
3. Click the "Replace" dropdown next to that player
4. See only unselected players from the 30-player pool
5. Select replacement → Instant update

### Bulk Player Replacement:
1. Enable "Bulk Edit" mode
2. Select multiple teams using checkboxes
3. "Replace Player" dropdown shows only players IN selected teams

5. Apply to all selected teams at once

## ✨ Benefits
