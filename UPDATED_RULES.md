### 🔧 **Implementation Details**

#### Backend Changes:
- Updated `PlayerService.validateTeamSelection()` in `/src/services/playerService.ts`
- Changed BAT validation from `3-6` to `3-5`
- Changed BOWL validation from `3-6` to `3-5`

#### Frontend Changes:
- Updated UI display in `/src/app/select/[matchId]/page.tsx`
- Changed BAT counter from `/6` to `/5`
- Changed BOWL counter from `/6` to `/5`
- Updated `handlePlayerToggle()` logic to enforce new limits
- Added dynamic role limit checking with proper error messages

#### Validation Logic:
```typescript
// BAT players: 3-5 allowed
if (batCount < 3 || batCount > 5) {
  validation.errors.push('Must have 3-5 Batsmen')
}

// BOWL players: 3-5 allowed  
if (bowlCount < 3 || bowlCount > 5) {
  validation.errors.push('Must have 3-5 Bowlers')
}
```

### 🎮 **User Experience**

#### What Users See:
1. **Role Counters**: Display updated limits (BAT: x/5, BOWL: x/5)
2. **Selection Limits**: Cannot select more than 5 BAT or 5 BOWL players
3. **Error Messages**: Clear feedback when limits are exceeded
4. **Visual Feedback**: Real-time validation during team selection

#### Error Messages:
