# Static Assets 404 Errors - FIXED

## Issue Description
The Next.js application was serving pages successfully but returning 404 errors for static assets (CSS and JavaScript files), causing the UI to appear broken with no styling or interactivity.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by the PWA (Progressive Web App) configuration in `next.config.js`. The `next-pwa` plugin was interfering with static asset serving during development, causing:
- CSS files to return 404 errors
- JavaScript bundles to fail loading
- UI appearing unstyled and non-functional

## Solution Applied
Updated `next.config.js` to properly disable PWA during development:

```javascript
const withPWA = require('next-pwa')({
  dest: 'public',
  disable: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development', // Key fix - disable in development
  register: true,
  skipWaiting: true,
  runtimeCaching: [],
  fallbacks: {
    document: '/offline',
  },
})
```

## Key Changes
1. **Ensured PWA is disabled in development**: `disable: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development'`
2. **Added proper PWA configuration**: Added `runtimeCaching` and `fallbacks` for production builds
3. **Cleared Next.js cache**: Removed `.next` directory to ensure clean build

## Verification
✅ Static assets now load correctly (CSS, JS files)
✅ UI styling and animations working properly
✅ No more 404 errors in development console
✅ PWA features will still work in production builds

## Files Modified
- `next.config.js` - Updated PWA configuration

## Status: RESOLVED
The Dream11 Multi Team Creation Assistant is now fully functional with proper styling and interactivity.
